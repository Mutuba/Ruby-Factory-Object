S.O.L.I.D

S= Single Responsibilty priciple. A class should be responsible for one aspect in the program, hence when need for a change only specific part of the program is affected.

O = Open/Closed Principle. A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. A good example is Enumerable and Array classes that are easily extendable.

L - Liskov Substitution Priciple. This principle is based on the fact that a derived class must be substitutable by its base class

I - Inteface Segregation Principle

D - Dependancy Inversion Priciple
